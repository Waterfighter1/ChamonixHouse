At Charmonix we want to help make your house nice. We aim to find and sell very cool things that have history and intrinsic value - whether it be a post modern Italian designed chair, a one hundred year old hand-woven tribal Persian rug or a Soviet-era propaganda poster.

Chamonix House was founded in 2016 by husband and wife team Nick and Jess Rochefort. Both lovers of all things home, they bring decades of sourcing and selection experience with them.

Chamonix opened as a small antiques store in rural Scituate, Rhode Island where Nick and Jess currently reside with their daughet Alice. The store was voted "Best Eclectic Antiques" in 2017 by Rhode Island Monthly Magazine. After three years of operating its physical location and shifted to an online only retail platform.

Rather than focusing on a specific era or style, Chamonix sources items with intrinsic value and style from all times - handmade rugs, hand carved furnishings, hand blown glass or designers of note.

The selection is varied and always evolving with a current focus on Antique and Vintage Persian rugs, Contemporary Art and Posters, and Objects for the home. Items sourced from all over the globe - from New England auction houses to European art and rug sources.

Goods from Chamonix have found homes in NYC restaurants The Flower Shop, Speedy Romeo and Relationships NYC as well as retailers Jayson Home, One Kings Lane, ABC Carpet & Home and Urban Cowboy Nashville.
